# Triple-Aware Generation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of our paper:  
**"Triple-Aware Generation for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Contrastive Alignment"** (2025)

Our approach introduces a novel two-stage pipeline for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) that combines robust triplet extraction with faithful explanation generation, setting a new state-of-the-art on multiple ABSA benchmarks while being memory-efficient enough to run on consumer hardware.

## Key Innovations

1. **Triplet-Aware Generation**: A novel attention mechanism that explicitly aligns extracted triplets with generated text, ensuring factuality and completeness in explanations.

2. **Contrastive Verification**: A semantic alignment module that enforces consistency between extracted triplets and generated explanations using contrastive learning.

3. **Hierarchical Aspect-Sectioned Templates**: A structured generation approach that organizes explanations by aspect for improved readability and comprehension.

4. **Memory-Efficient Implementation**: Optimized architecture that can run efficiently on consumer hardware (8-16GB RAM) while maintaining SOTA performance.

5. **Triplet Recovery Metric**: A novel evaluation metric that measures how accurately the original triplets can be recovered from generated explanations.

## Model Architecture

Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline:

1. **Extraction Stage**: A lightweight span detector with optimized attention mechanisms identifies aspect terms, opinion terms, and sentiment polarity.

2. **Generation Stage**: A triplet-aware decoder generates natural language explanations conditioned on the extracted triplets.

## Performance

### Triplet Extraction Performance (F1)

| Model | Rest14 | Rest15 | Rest16 | Laptop14 | MAMS | Avg |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|----------|------|-----|
| ASOTE (2022) | 64.2 | 58.9 | 58.2 | 59.8 | 55.4 | 59.3 |
| SpanABSA (2023) | 67.3 | 62.5 | 63.1 | 62.4 | 58.2 | 62.7 |
| MASCOT-BERT (2024) | 69.8 | 65.2 | 65.9 | 64.3 | 60.5 | 65.1 |
| **Ours-MiniLM** | 70.2 | 66.1 | 66.8 | 64.9 | 60.9 | 65.8 |
| **Ours-RoBERTa** | **72.5** | **68.3** | **69.7** | **66.8** | **62.4** | **67.9** |

### Generation Faithfulness (TRS / F1)

| Model | TRS | BERTScore | Faithfulness |
|-------|-----|-----------|--------------|
| BART+ASOTE (2022) | 0.58 | 0.82 | 0.65 |
| T5+SpanABSA (2023) | 0.62 | 0.85 | 0.73 |
| ABSA-Phi (2024) | 0.67 | 0.88 | 0.79 |
| **Ours-Phi1.5** | 0.71 | 0.89 | 0.82 |
| **Ours-Phi2** | **0.76** | **0.91** | **0.87** |

TRS = Triplet Recovery Score (our proposed metric)

## Memory Requirements

Our approach is highly memory-efficient and can be run on consumer hardware:

| Configuration | Memory Usage | Inference Time | Training Time |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| MemoryConstrained | 2-4GB VRAM | 0.15s/sample | 1.2h/epoch |
| Default | 4-8GB VRAM | 0.08s/sample | 0.8h/epoch |
| HighPerformance | 8-16GB VRAM | 0.05s/sample | 0.5h/epoch |

## Quick Start

### Extract Triplets and Generate Explanations

```python
from src.models.generative_absa import LLMABSA
from src.utils.config import LLMABSAConfig
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

# Load configuration
config = LLMABSAConfig()

# Load model and tokenizer
model = LLMABSA(config)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('checkpoints/generative_absa_rest15.pt'))
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(config.model_name)

# Analyze text
text = "The food was delicious but the service was terrible."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model(**inputs, generate=True)

# Get extracted triplets
triplets = model._extract_triplets_batch(
    outputs['aspect_logits'],
    outputs['opinion_logits'],
    outputs['sentiment_logits'],
    inputs['input_ids'],
    tokenizer
)

# Generate explanation
explanation = model.generate_explanation(inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask'])

print("Extracted Triplets:", triplets)
print("Generated Explanation:", explanation)
```

### Training

```bash
# Standard training
python train.py --dataset rest15 --device cuda

# Low-memory training
python train.py --dataset rest15 --config memory_constrained --device cuda 

# High-performance training
python train.py --dataset rest15 --config high_performance --device cuda
```

### Evaluation

```bash
# Evaluate extraction
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/generative_absa_rest15.pt --dataset rest15 --mode extraction

# Evaluate generation
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/generative_absa_rest15.pt --dataset rest15 --mode generation

# Evaluate both
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/generative_absa_rest15.pt --dataset rest15 --mode all
```

## Examples

### Triplet Extraction

Input: "The pizza has a delicious taste but the crust was too thick and chewy."

Extracted Triplets:
```
[
  {
    "aspect": "pizza",
    "opinion": "delicious taste",
    "sentiment": "POS"
  },
  {
    "aspect": "crust",
    "opinion": "too thick",
    "sentiment": "NEG"
  },
  {
    "aspect": "crust",
    "opinion": "chewy",
    "sentiment": "NEG"
  }
]
```

### Generated Explanation

```
The pizza has a positive sentiment because of its delicious taste. However, the crust has a negative sentiment due to being too thick and chewy, which detracts from the overall experience.
```
